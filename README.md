## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aanchal Jha!

I'm an incoming Computer Science undergraduate at IGDTUW (2025â€“2029).  
I'm just beginning my journey into programming and open-source, and Iâ€™m really excited to explore the tech world, build, and learn by doing.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- Building a strong foundation in C and C++
- Understanding Git workflows and collaborative coding
- Practising DSA through coding platforms(Hacker-rank, Leetcode, w3resource.com)
- Planning to explore basic web development (HTML, CSS)
- Studying discrete mathematics through YouTube and NPTEL to build the foundation for competitive programming
- ðŸŒ¸ Iâ€™m applying for GirlScript Summer of Code 2025 to contribute to real-world open-source projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C programming, Discrete mathematics, Data Structures, Git & GitHub
  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for help with navigating open-source programs and getting guidance from mentors and contributors.
